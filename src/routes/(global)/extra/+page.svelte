        <h3>So how do zodiacs for alters work?</h3>

        <p>To be honest, it's just whatever makes sense for the individual. There's no real science involved in what we do for ourselves, it's all for fun! Take it as seriously or unseriously as you feel like.</p>
        <p>(Do be respectful, however)</p>
        <p>For some of us, we get our "main three" signs by doing a chart based on what time an individual was logged in PK. For some others, the signs are based on source. For yet more, the sign is just vibes.</p>
